# System Tray Icon for NordVPN

I am a NordVPN user on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and, unfortunately, there is no widget or something that indicates if I am connected or not.
So, often I forget to connect to NordVPN and that means I am navigating unsafely.

Thus, to overcome this problem, I decided to write this QT code to solve this problem and hopefully this can be useful to someone else as well.
